# Gradle 5.0 preview features

## Enhanced support for Maven repositories

Because these improvements change the resolution result for certain Gradle `Configuration` instances, we consider them to be "potentially breaking changes". As such, these improvements are _opt-in_ for the Gradle 4.x stream of releases, but we expect to make them the default in Gradle 5.0.

### Dependency constraints from Maven POM files

With the introduction of 'dependency constraints', Gradle can now provide a better experience for consumers of Maven repositories. There is not a clear 1:1 mapping between dependency constraints and Maven POM features, but there are some cases where it makes sense for Gradle to map a Maven POM feature to a dependency constraint. 

#### Maven `optional` dependencies

Whenever a POM file contains a dependency with `<optional>true</optional>`, Gradle 5.0 will create a _dependency constraint_ for that dependency. This constraint will produce the expected result for an optional dependency: if the dependency module is brought into the graph by another edge, then the constraint will apply when choosing the version for that dependency.

#### Maven BOM files and `<dependencyManagement>`

Gradle now provides support for a "Maven BOM" file, which is effectively a POM file that uses `<dependencyManagement>` to control the dependency versions for another project. Since Gradle has no concept of a "parent POM" file, support for Maven BOM is similar to the use of `<scope>import</scope>` when depending on a BOM in Maven, but is done via a regular dependency declaration.

When Gradle discovers a dependency on a Maven BOM file, all dependencies declared in the `<dependencyManagement>` block are treated as Gradle _dependency constraints_. This means that any `<dependencyManagement>` versions defined in the BOM file can impact the resolved graph. Gradle treats any POM file with `<packaging>pom</packaging>` as a potential BOM file: if a dependency resolves to a Maven module with `pom` packaging, then a _dependency constraint_ will be produced for every dependency declared in a `dependencyManagement` block. 

Note one major difference between the handling of BOM files in Maven and Gradle: a dependency on a BOM is just a regular dependency, and can be published and resolved transitively just like any other dependency. This is different from Maven, where a BOM is _imported_ into the build, and downstream consumers do not automatically benefit from the dependency constraints defined. For example, if project A depends on project B, and project B _imports_ the BOM for project C, then a dependency declared in project A will not use the versions defined in project C.

### Runtime scoped dependencies are not included in Java compile classpath

Since v1.0, Gradle has been included `runtime` scoped dependencies in the Java compile classpath. While this often works fine, it has a number of drawbacks:
- It's easy to publish a compile-time dependency with `runtime` scope, causing issues for non-Gradle consumers
- The compile classpath is much larger than it needs to be, slowing down compilation
- The compile classpath includes `runtime` files that do not impact compilation, resulting in unnecessary re-compilation when these files change.

With Gradle 5.0, we intend to change this behaviour. A Maven POM will be considered to define an `api` and `runtime` variant for a Java library, with the `api` variant only including `compile` scoped dependencies. The Java compile classpath will use the `api` variant for each resolved dependency, while the Java runtime classpath will use the `runtime` variant. The net result is that `runtime` scoped dependencies will no longer be available in the compile classpath.

## New Gradle `.module` metadata format

In order to provide rich support for variant-aware dependency management and dependency constraints, Gradle 5.0 will define a new module metadata format, that can be used in conjunction with Ivy descriptor and Maven POM files in existing repositories.
This new metadata format is under active development, so we have made it _opt-in_ for the Gradle 4.x stream.

Issues with enabling it by default in Gradle 4.x:
- We do not yet guarantee backward or forward compatibility for the metadata file format. Thus, resolution may change when upgrading Gradle, if a metadata file is published with an old format.
- An additional request is required for Maven and Ivy repositories to check for the new metadata file.

## Gradle does not search for `.jar` file when POM/Ivy file is missing

A regular `maven` or `ivy` module will be defined by the presence of a `pom` or `ivy.xml` file. However, Gradle will also search for a `.jar` file in these repositories, in the off chance that the module was "published" without any metadata file. If the jar file is discovered, it's considered to be a module with no dependencies.

This behaviour will no longer be the default in Gradle 5.0, reducing the number of network requests and working in a less surprising manner. It will be possible to opt-in to these "artifact only modules" by configuring the `metadataSources` for a repository.
