= The Build Announcements Plugin

[CAUTION]
====
This plugin is deprecated and will be removed in the next major Gradle release. New builds should not use this plugin.
====

The build announcements plugin uses the <<announce_plugin.adoc#announce_plugin,announce>> plugin to send local announcements on important events in the build.

== Usage
