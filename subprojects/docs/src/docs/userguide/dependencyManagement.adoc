== Dependency Management


[[sec:Introduction]]
=== Introduction

Dependency management is a critical feature of every build, and Gradle has placed an emphasis on offering first-class dependency management that is both easy to understand and compatible with a wide variety of approaches. If you are familiar with the approach used by either Maven or Ivy you will be delighted to learn that Gradle is fully compatible with both approaches in addition to being flexible enough to support fully-customized approaches.

Here are the major highlights of Gradle's support for dependency management:

* _Transitive dependency management_: Gradle gives you full control of your project's dependency tree.
* _Support for non-managed dependencies_: If your dependencies are simply files in version control or a shared drive, Gradle provides powerful functionality to support this.
* _Support for custom dependency definitions._: Gradle's Module Dependencies give you the ability to describe the dependency hierarchy in the build script.
* _A fully customizable approach to Dependency Resolution_: Gradle provides you with the ability to customize resolution rules making dependency substitution easy.
* _Full Compatibility with Maven and Ivy_: If you have defined dependencies in a Maven POM or an Ivy file, Gradle provides seamless integration with a range of popular build tools.
* _Integration with existing dependency management infrastructure_: Gradle is compatible with both Maven and Ivy repositories. If you use Archiva, Nexus, or Artifactory, Gradle is 100% compatible with all repository formats.

With hundreds of thousands of interdependent open source components each with a range of versions and incompatibilities, dependency management has a habit of causing problems as builds grow in complexity. When a build's dependency tree becomes unwieldy, your build tool shouldn't force you to adopt a single, inflexible approach to dependency management. A proper build system has to be designed to be flexible, and Gradle can handle any situation.


[[sub:dependency_management_and_migrations]]
==== Flexible dependency management for migrations

Dependency management can be particularly challenging during a migration from one build system to another. If you are migrating from a tool like Ant or Maven to Gradle, you may be faced with some difficult situations. For example, one common pattern is an Ant project with version-less jar files stored in the filesystem. Other build systems require a wholesale replacement of this approach before migrating. With Gradle, you can adapt your new build to any existing source of dependencies or dependency metadata. This makes incremental migration to Gradle much easier than the alternative. On most large projects, build migrations and any change to development process is incremental because most organizations can't afford to stop everything and migrate to a build tool's idea of dependency management.

Even if your project is using a custom dependency management system or something like an Eclipse .classpath file as master data for dependency management, it is very easy to write a Gradle plugin to use this data in Gradle. For migration purposes this is a common technique with Gradle. (But, once you've migrated, it might be a good idea to move away from a .classpath file and use Gradle's dependency management features directly.)

[[sub:dependency_management_and_java]]
==== Dependency management and Java

It is ironic that in a language known for its rich library of open source components that Java has no concept of libraries or versions. In Java, there is no standard way to tell the JVM that you are using version 3.0.5 of Hibernate, and there is no standard way to say that `foo-1.0.jar` depends on `bar-2.0.jar`. This has led to external solutions often based on build tools. The most popular ones at the moment are Maven and Ivy. While Maven provides a complete build system, Ivy focuses solely on dependency management.

Both tools rely on descriptor XML files, which contain information about the dependencies of a particular jar. Both also use repositories where the actual jars are placed together with their descriptor files, and both offer resolution for conflicting jar versions in one form or the other. Both have emerged as standards for solving dependency conflicts, and while Gradle originally used Ivy under the hood for its dependency management. Gradle has replaced this direct dependency on Ivy with a native Gradle dependency resolution engine which supports a range of approaches to dependency resolution including both POM and Ivy descriptor files.

[[sec:declaring_dependencies]]
=== Declaring dependencies

Gradle builds can declare dependencies on external binaries, raw files and other Gradle projects. You can find examples for common scenarios in this section. For more information, see the <<dependency_types,full reference on all types of dependencies>>.

[[sec:declaring_binary_dependency]]
==== Declaring a binary dependency

Modern software projects rarely build code in isolation. Projects reference external libraries for the purpose of reusing existing and proven functionality, so-called _binary dependencies_. Upon resolution binary dependencies are downloaded from dedicated repositories and stored in a cache to avoid unnecessary network traffic.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Resolving binary dependencies from remote repositories</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-binary-dependencies.png" width="150mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

===== Declaring a concrete version of a binary dependency

A typical example for such a library in a Java project is the link:https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/[Spring framework]. The following code snippet declares a compile-time dependency on the Spring web module by its coordinates: `org.springframework:spring-web:5.0.2.RELEASE`. Gradle resolves the dependency including its transitive dependencies from the link:https://search.maven.org/[Maven Central repository] and uses it to compile Java source code. The version attribute of the dependency coordinates points to a _concrete version_ indicating that the underlying artifacts don't change over time. The use of concrete versions ensures reproducibility for the aspect of dependency resolution.

++++
<sample id="binary-dependencies-concrete-version" dir="userguide/dependencies/declaringBinaryDependenciesWithConcreteVersion" title="Declaring a binary dependencies with a concrete version">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="binary-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

A Gradle project can define other types of repositories hosting binary dependencies. You can learn more about the syntax and API in the section on <<sec:declaring_repositories,declaring repositories>>. Refer to <<java_plugin>> for a deep dive on declaring dependencies for a Java project. The resolution behavior for binary dependencies declarations is <<sec:customizing_dependencies,highly customizable>>.

===== Declaring a dynamic version of a binary dependency

Projects might adopt a more aggressive approach for consuming binary dependencies. For example you might want to always integrate the latest version of a dependency to consume cutting edge features at any given time. A _dynamic version_ allows for resolving the latest version or the latest version of a version range for a given dependency.

[NOTE]
====
Using dynamic versions in a build bears the risk of potentially breaking it. As soon as a new version of the dependency is released that contains an incompatible API change your source code might stop compiling.
====

++++
<sample id="binary-dependencies-dynamic-version" dir="userguide/dependencies/declaringBinaryDependenciesWithDynamicVersion" title="Declaring a binary dependencies with a dynamic version">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="binary-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

A link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] can effectively visualize dynamic dependency versions and their respective, selected versions.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Dynamic dependencies in build scan</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-dynamic-dependency-build-scan.png" width="135mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions of dependencies for 24 hours. The <<sec:controlling_caching,threshold can be configured>> as needed for example if you want to resolve new versions earlier.

===== Declaring a changing version of a binary dependency

A team might decide to implement a series of features before releasing a new version of the application or library. A common strategy to allow consumers to integrate an unfinished version of their artifacts early and often is to release a so-called _changing version_. A changing version indicates that the feature set is still under active development and hasn't released a stable version for general availability yet.

In Maven repositories, changing versions are commonly referred to as link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#What_is_a_SNAPSHOT_version[snapshot versions]. Snapshot versions contain the suffix `-SNAPSHOT`. The following example demonstrates how to declare a snapshot version on the Spring dependency.

++++
<sample id="binary-dependencies-changing-version" dir="userguide/dependencies/declaringBinaryDependenciesWithChangingVersion" title="Declaring a binary dependencies with a changing version">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="binary-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

By default, Gradle caches changing versions of dependencies for 24 hours. The <<sec:controlling_caching,threshold can be configured>> as needed for example if you want to resolve new snapshot versions earlier.

Gradle is flexible enough to treat any version as changing version. All you need to do is to set the property api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ExternalModuleDependency#setChanging(boolean)[] to `true`.

[[sec:declaring_file_dependency]]
==== Declaring a file dependency

Projects sometimes do not rely on a binary repository product e.g. JFrog Artifactory or Sonatype Nexus for hosting and resolving external dependencies. It's common practice to host those dependencies on a shared drive or check them into version control alongside the project source code. Those dependencies are referred to as _file dependencies_, the reason being that they represent a files without any metadata (like information about transitive dependencies, the origin or its author) attached to them.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Resolving file dependencies from the local file system and a shared drive</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-file-dependencies.png" width="140mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

The following example resolves file dependencies from the directories `ant`, `libs` and `tools`.

++++
<sample id="file-dependencies" dir="userguide/dependencies/declaringFileDependencies" title="Declaring multiple file dependencies">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="file-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

As you can see in the code example, every dependency has to define its exact location in the file system. The most prominent methods for creating a file reference are api:org.gradle.api.Project#files(java.lang.Object...)[] and api:org.gradle.api.Project#fileTree(java.lang.Object)[]. Alternatively, you can also define the source directory of one or many file dependencies in the form of a <<sec:flat_dir_resolver,flat directory repository>>.

[[sec:declaring_project_dependency]]
==== Declaring a project dependency

Software projects often break up software components into modules to improve maintainability and prevent strong coupling. Modules can define dependencies between each other to reuse code within the same project.

Gradle can model dependencies between modules. Those dependencies are called _project dependencies_ because each module is represented by a Gradle project. At runtime, the build automatically ensures that project dependencies are built in the correct order and added to the classpath for compilation. The chapter <<multi_project_builds>> discusses how to set up and configure multi-project builds in more detail.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Dependencies between projects</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-project-dependencies.png" width="100mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

The following example declares the dependencies on the `utils` and `api` project from the `web-service` project. The method api:org.gradle.api.Project#project(java.lang.String)[] creates a reference to a specific subproject by path.

++++
<sample id="project-dependencies" dir="userguide/dependencies/declaringProjectDependencies" title="Declaring project dependencies">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="project-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

[[sub:scope_of_dependency_configurations]]
==== Defining the scope of a dependency

Every dependency declared for a Gradle project applies to a specific scope. For example some dependencies should be used for compiling source code whereas others only need to be available at runtime. Gradle represents the scope of a dependency with the help of a api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration[].

Many Gradle plugins add pre-defined configurations to your project. The Java plugin, for example, adds configurations to represent the various classpaths it needs for source code compilation, executing tests and the like. See <<sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management,the Java plugin chapter>> for an example. The sections above demonstrate how to <<sec:declaring_dependencies,declare dependencies>> for different use cases.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Configurations use declared dependencies for specific purposes</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-configurations.png" width="200mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

You can also define configurations yourself, so-called _custom configurations_. A custom configuration is useful for separating the scope of dependencies needed for a dedicated purpose.

Let's say you wanted to declare a dependency on the link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/jasper-howto.html[Jasper Ant task] for the purpose of pre-compiling JSP files that should _not_ end up in the classpath for compiling your source code. It's fairly simply to achieve that goal by introducing a custom configuration and using it in a task.

++++
<sample id="custom-configuration" dir="userguide/dependencies/declaringCustomConfigurations" title="Declaring and using a custom configuration">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="custom-configuration"/>
</sample>
++++

A project's configurations are managed by a `configurations` object. Configurations have a name and can extend each other. To learn more about this API have a look at api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ConfigurationContainer[].

[[sub:resolve_specific_artifacts_from_dependency]]
==== Resolving specific artifacts from a module dependency

Whenever Gradle tries to resolve a dependency from a Maven or Ivy repository, it looks for a metadata file and the default artifact file, a JAR. The build fails if none of these artifact files can be resolved. Under certain conditions, you might want to tweak the way Gradle resolves artifacts for a dependency.

- The dependency only provides a non-standard artifact without any metadata e.g. a ZIP file.
- The dependency metadata declares more than one artifact e.g. as part of an Ivy dependency descriptor.
- You only want to download a specific artifact without any of the transitive dependencies declared in the metadata.

Gradle is a polyglot build tool and not limited to just resolving Java libraries. Let's assume you wanted to build a web application using JavaScript as the client technology. Most projects check in external JavaScript libraries into version control. An external JavaScript library is no different than a reusable Java library so why not download it from a repository instead?

link:https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/[Google Hosted Libraries] is a distribution platform for popular, open-source JavaScript libraries. With the help of the artifact-only notation you can download a JavaScript library file e.g. JQuery. The `@` character separates the dependency's coordinates from the artifact's file extension.

++++
<sample id="artifact-only-dependency-declaration" dir="userguide/dependencies/resolvingArtifactOnly" title="Resolving a JavaScript artifact for a declared dependency">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="artifact-only-dependency-declaration"/>
</sample>
++++

Some dependencies ship different "flavors" of the same artifact or they publish multiple artifacts that belong to a specific version of the dependency but have a different purpose. It's common for a Java library to publish the artifact with the compiled class files, another one with just the source code in it and a third one containing the Javadocs.

In JavaScript, a library may exist as uncompressed or minified artifact. In Gradle, a specific artifact identifier is called _classifier_, a term generally used in Maven and Ivy dependency management.

Let's say we wanted to download the minified artifact of the JQuery library instead of the uncompressed file. You can provide the classifier `min` as part of the dependency declaration.

++++
<sample id="artifact-only-dependency-declaration-with-classifier" dir="userguide/dependencies/resolvingArtifactOnlyWithClassifier" title="Resolving a JavaScript artifact with classifier for a declared dependency">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="artifact-only-dependency-declaration"/>
</sample>
++++

[[sec:managing_transitive_dependencies]]
=== Managing transitive dependencies

Resolution behavior for transitive dependencies can be customized to a high degree to meet enterprise requirements.

[[sec:excluding_transitive_module_dependencies]]
==== Excluding transitive module dependencies

Declared dependencies in a build script can pull in a lot of transitive dependencies. You might decide that you do not want a particular transitive dependency as part of the dependency graph for a good reason.

- The dependency is undesired due to licensing constraints.
- The dependency is not available in any of the declared repositories.
- The metadata for the dependency exists but the artifact does not.
- The metadata provides incorrect coordinates for a transitive dependency.

Transitive dependencies can be excluded on the level of a declared dependency or a configuration. Let's demonstrate both use cases. In the following two examples the build script declares a dependency on Log4J, a popular logging framework in the Java world. The metadata of the particular version of Log4J also defines transitive dependencies.

++++
<sample id="unresolvedTransitiveDependencies" dir="userguide/dependencies/unresolvedTransitiveDependencies" title="Unresolved artifacts for transitive dependencies">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="unresolved-transitive-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

If resolved from Maven Central some of the transitive dependencies provide metadata but not the corresponding binary artifact. As a result any task requiring the binary files will fail e.g. a compilation task.

```
> gradle -q compileJava

* What went wrong:
Could not resolve all files for configuration ':compileClasspath'.
> Could not find jms.jar (javax.jms:jms:1.1).
  Searched in the following locations:
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/javax/jms/jms/1.1/jms-1.1.jar
> Could not find jmxtools.jar (com.sun.jdmk:jmxtools:1.2.1).
  Searched in the following locations:
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jdmk/jmxtools/1.2.1/jmxtools-1.2.1.jar
> Could not find jmxri.jar (com.sun.jmx:jmxri:1.2.1).
  Searched in the following locations:
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jmx/jmxri/1.2.1/jmxri-1.2.1.jar
```

The situation can be fixed by adding a repository containing those dependencies. In the given example project, the source code does not actually use any of Log4J's functionality that require the JMS (e.g. link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.html[`JMSAppender`]) or JMX libraries. It's safe to exclude them from the dependency declaration.

Exclusions need to spelled out as a key/value pair via the attributes `group` and/or `module`. For more information, refer to api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ModuleDependency#exclude(java.util.Map)[].

++++
<sample id="exclude-transitive-for-dependency" dir="userguide/dependencies/excludingTransitiveDependenciesForDependency" title="Excluding transitive dependency for a particular dependency declaration">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="exclude-transitive-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

You may find that other dependencies will want to pull in the same transitive dependency that misses the artifacts. Alternatively, you can exclude the transitive dependencies for a particular configuration by calling the method api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration#exclude(java.util.Map)[].

++++
<sample id="exclude-transitive-for-configuration" dir="userguide/dependencies/excludingTransitiveDependenciesForConfiguration" title="Excluding transitive dependency for a particular configuration">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="exclude-transitive-dependencies"/>
</sample>
++++

[NOTE]
====
As a build script author you often times know that you want to exclude a dependency for all configurations available in the project. You can use the method api:org.gradle.api.DomainObjectCollection#all(org.gradle.api.Action)[] to define a global rule.
====

You might encounter other use cases that don't quite fit the bill of an exclude rule. For example you want to automatically select a version for a dependency with a specific requested version or you want to select a different group for a requested dependency to react to a relocation. Those use cases are better solved by the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[] API. Some of these use cases are covered in <<sec:finetuning_the_dependency_resolution_process>>.

[[sec:enforcing_dependency_version]]
==== Enforcing a particular dependency version

Gradle resolves any dependency version conflicts by selecting the latest version found in the dependency graph. Some projects might need to divert from the default behavior and enforce an earlier version of a dependency e.g. if the source code of the project depends on an older API of a dependency than some of the external libraries.

[NOTE]
====
Enforcing a version of a dependency requires a conscious decision. Changing the version of a transitive dependency might lead to runtime errors if external libraries do not properly function without them. Consider upgrading your source code to use a newer version of the library as an alternative approach.
====

Let's say a project uses the link:https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/[HttpClient library] for performing HTTP calls. HttpClient pulls in link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/[Commons Codec] as transitive dependency with version 1.10. However, the production source code of the project requires an API from Commons Codec 1.9 which is not available in 1.10 anymore. A dependency version can be enforced by declaring it in the build script and setting api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ExternalDependency#setForce(boolean)[] to `true`.

++++
<sample id="force-per-dependency" dir="userguide/dependencies/forcingDependencyVersion" title="Enforcing a dependency version">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="force-per-dependency"/>
</sample>
++++

If the project requires a specific version of a dependency on a configuration-level then it can be achieved by calling the method api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy#force(java.lang.Object...)[].

++++
<sample id="force-per-configuration" dir="userguide/dependencies/forcingDependencyVersionPerConfiguration" title="Enforcing a dependency version on the configuration-level">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="force-per-configuration"/>
</sample>
++++

[[sub:disabling_resolution_transitive_dependencies]]
==== Disabling resolution of transitive dependencies

By default Gradle resolves all transitive dependencies specified by the dependency metadata. Sometimes this behavior may not be desirable e.g. if the metadata is incorrect or defines a large graph of transitive dependencies. You can tell Gradle to disable transitive dependency management for a dependency by setting api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ModuleDependency#setTransitive(boolean)[] to `true`. As a result only the main artifact will be resolved for the declared dependency.

++++
<sample id="disabling-transitive-dependency-resolution" dir="userguide/dependencies/disablingTransitiveDependencyResolution" title="Disabling transitive dependency resolution for a declared dependency">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="transitive-per-dependency"/>
</sample>
++++

[NOTE]
====
Disabling transitive dependency resolution will likely require you to declare the necessary runtime dependencies in your build script which otherwise would have been resolved automatically. Not doing so might lead to runtime classpath issues.
====

A project can decide to disable transitive dependency resolution completely. You either don't want to rely on the metadata published to the consumed repositories or you want to gain full control over the dependencies in your graph. For more information, see api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration#setTransitive(boolean)[].

++++
<sample id="disabling-transitive-dependency-resolution-for-configuration" dir="userguide/dependencies/disablingTransitiveDependencyResolutionForConfiguration" title="Disabling transitive dependency resolution on the configuration-level">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="transitive-per-configuration"/>
</sample>
++++

[[sec:inspecting_dependencies]]
=== Inspecting dependencies

Gradle provides sufficient tooling to navigate large dependency graphs and mitigate situations that can lead to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell[dependency hell]. Users can chose to render the full graph of dependencies as well as identify the selection reason and origin for a dependency. The origin of a dependency can be a declared dependency in the build script or a transitive dependency in graph plus their corresponding configuration. Gradle offers both capabilities through visual representation via build scans and as command line tooling.

[[sec:listing_dependencies]]
==== Listing dependencies in a project

A project can declare one or more dependencies. Gradle can visualize the whole dependency tree for every configuration available in the project.

Rendering the dependency tree is particularly useful if you'd like to identify which dependencies have been resolved at runtime. It also provides you with information about any dependency conflict resolution that occurred in the process and clearly indicates the selected version. The dependency report always contains declared and transitive dependencies.

Let's say you'd want to create tasks for your project that use the link:https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit library] to execute SCM operations e.g. to model a release process. You can declare dependencies for any external tooling with the help of a <<sub:scope_of_dependency_configurations,custom configuration>> so that it doesn't doesn't pollute other contexts like the compilation classpath for your production source code.

++++
<sample id="jgit-dependency" dir="userguide/dependencies/dependenciesReport" title="Declaring the JGit dependency with a custom configuration">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependency-declaration" />
</sample>
++++

A link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] can visualize dependencies as a navigable, searchable tree. Additional context information can be rendered by clicking on a specific dependency in the graph.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Dependency tree in a build scan</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-dependencies-report-build-scan.png" width="180mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

Every Gradle project provides the task `dependencies` to render the so-called _dependency report_ from the command line. By default the dependency report renders dependencies for all configurations. To pair down on the information provide the optional parameter `--configuration`.

++++
<sample id="dependencyReport" dir="userguide/dependencies/dependenciesReport" title="Rendering the dependency report for a custom configuration">
    <output args="-q dependencies --configuration scm"/>
</sample>
++++

The dependencies report provides detailed information about the dependencies available in the graph. Any dependency that could not be resolved is marked with `FAILED` in red color. Dependencies with the same coordinates that can occur multiple times in the graph are omitted and indicated by an asterisk. Dependencies that had to undergo conflict resolution render the requested and selected version separated by a right arrow character.

==== Identifying which dependency version was selected and why

Large software projects inevitably deal with an increased number of dependencies either through direct or transitive dependencies. The <<sec:listing_dependencies,dependencies report>> provides you with the raw list of dependencies but does not explain _why_ they have been selected or _which_ dependency is responsible for pulling them into the graph.

Let's have a look at a concrete example. A project may request two different versions of the same dependency either as direct or transitive dependency. Gradle applies version conflict resolution to ensure that only one version of the dependency exists in the dependency graph. In this example the conflicting dependency is represented by `commons-codec:commons-codec`.

++++
<sample id="jgit-dependency-with-conflict" dir="userguide/dependencies/dependencyInsightReport" title="Declaring the JGit dependency and a conflicting dependency">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependency-declaration" />
</sample>
++++

The dependency tree in a link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] renders the selection reason (conflict resolution) as well as the origin of a dependency if you click on a dependency and select the "Required By" tab.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Dependency insight capabilities in a build scan</title>

        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-dependency-insight-report-build-scan.png" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

Every Gradle project provides the task `dependencyInsight` to render the so-called  _dependency insight report_ from the command line. Given a dependency in the dependency graph you can identify the selection reason and track down the origin of the dependency selection. You can think of the dependency insight report as the inverse representation of the dependency report for a given dependency. When executing the task you have to provide the mandatory parameter `--dependency` to specify the coordinates of the dependency under inspection. The parameter `--configuration` is optional but helps with filtering the output.

[[sec:working_with_dependencies]]
=== Working with dependencies

For the examples below we have the following dependencies setup:

++++
<sample id="configurationHandlingSetup" dir="userguide/artifacts/configurationHandling" title="Configuration.copy">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="setup"/>
        </sample>
++++

The dependencies have the following transitive dependencies:

shark-1.0 -&gt; seal-2.0, tuna-1.0

orca-1.0 -&gt; seal-1.0

tuna-1.0 -&gt; herring-1.0

You can use the configuration to access the declared dependencies or a subset of those:

++++
<sample id="configurationHandlingDependencies" dir="userguide/artifacts/configurationHandling" title="Accessing declared dependencies">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependencies"/>
            <output args="-q dependencies"/>
        </sample>
++++

The `dependencies` task returns only the dependencies belonging explicitly to the configuration. The `allDependencies` task includes the dependencies from extended configurations.

To get the library files of the configuration dependencies you can do:

++++
<sample id="configurationHandlingAllFiles" dir="userguide/artifacts/configurationHandling" title="Configuration.files">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="allFiles"/>
            <output args="-q allFiles"/>
        </sample>
++++

Sometimes you want the library files of a subset of the configuration dependencies (e.g. of a single dependency).

++++
<sample id="configurationHandlingFiles" dir="userguide/artifacts/configurationHandling" title="Configuration.files with spec">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="files"/>
            <output args="-q files"/>
        </sample>
++++

The `Configuration.files` method always retrieves all artifacts of the _whole_ configuration. It then filters the retrieved files by specified dependencies. As you can see in the example, transitive dependencies are included.

You can also copy a configuration. You can optionally specify that only a subset of dependencies from the original configuration should be copied. The copying methods come in two flavors. The `copy` method copies only the dependencies belonging explicitly to the configuration. The `copyRecursive` method copies all the dependencies, including the dependencies from extended configurations.

++++
<sample id="configurationHandlingCopy" dir="userguide/artifacts/configurationHandling" title="Configuration.copy">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="copy"/>
            <output args="-q copy"/>
        </sample>
++++

It is important to note that the returned files of the copied configuration are often but not always the same than the returned files of the dependency subset of the original configuration. In case of version conflicts between dependencies of the subset and dependencies not belonging to the subset the resolve result might be different.

++++
<sample id="configurationHandlingCopyVsFiles" dir="userguide/artifacts/configurationHandling" title="Configuration.copy vs. Configuration.files">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="copyVsFiles"/>
            <output args="-q copyVsFiles"/>
        </sample>
++++

In the example above, `orca` has a dependency on `seal-1.0` whereas `shark` has a dependency on `seal-2.0`. The original configuration has therefore a version conflict which is resolved to the newer `seal-2.0` version. The `files` method therefore returns `seal-2.0` as a transitive dependency of `orca`. The copied configuration only has `orca` as a dependency and therefore there is no version conflict and `seal-1.0` is returned as a transitive dependency.

Once a configuration is resolved it is immutable. Changing its state or the state of one of its dependencies will cause an exception. You can always copy a resolved configuration. The copied configuration is in the unresolved state and can be freshly resolved.

To learn more about the API of the configuration class see the API documentation: api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration[].

[[sec:declaring_repositories]]
=== Declaring repositories

Gradle can resolve external dependencies from one or many repositories based on Maven, Ivy or flat directory directory formats. Check out the <<repository_types,full reference on all types of repositories>> for more information.

[[sec:declaring_public_repository]]
==== Declaring a publicly-available repository

Organizations building software may want to leverage public binary repositories to download and consume open source dependencies. Popular public repositories include Maven Central, Bintray JCenter and the Google Android repository. Gradle provides built-in shortcut methods for the most widely-used repositories.

+++++
<figure xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Declaring a repository with the help of shortcut methods</title>
    <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="img/dependency-management-shortcut-repositories.png" width="120mm" />
    </imageobject>
</figure>
+++++

To declare JCenter as repository, add this code to your build script:

++++
<sample id="public-repository" dir="userguide/repositories/declaringPublicRepository" title="Declaring JCenter repository as source for resolving dependencies">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="public-repository"/>
</sample>
++++

Under the covers Gradle resolves dependencies from the respective URL of the public repository defined by the shortcut method. All shortcut methods are available via the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler[] API. Alternatively, you can <<sec:declaring_custom_repository,spell out the URL of the repository>> for more fine-grained control.

[[sec:declaring_custom_repository]]
==== Declaring a custom repository by URL

Most enterprise projects set up a binary repository available only within an intranet. In-house repositories enable teams to publish internal binaries, setup user management and security measure and ensure uptime and availability. Specifying a custom URL is also helpful if you want to declare a less popular, but publicly-available repository.

Add the following code to declare an in-house repository for your build reachable through a custom URL.

++++
<sample id="custom-repository" dir="userguide/repositories/declaringCustomRepository" title="Declaring a custom repository by URL">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="custom-repository"/>
</sample>
++++

Repositories with custom URLs can be specified as Maven or Ivy repositories by calling the corresponding methods available on the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler[] API. Gradle supports other protocols than `http` or `https` as part of the custom URL e.g. `file`, `sftp` or `s3`. For a full coverage see the <<sub:supported_transport_protocols,reference manual on supported transport protocols>>.

[[sec:declaring_multiple_repositories]]
==== Declaring multiple repositories

You can define more than one repository for resolving dependencies. Declaring multiple repositories is helpful if some dependencies are only available in one repository but not the other. You can mix any type of repository described in the <<repository_types,reference section>>.

This example demonstrates how to declare various shortcut and custom URL repositories for a project:

++++
<sample id="multiple-repositories" dir="userguide/repositories/declaringMultipleRepositories" title="Declaring multiple repositories">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="multiple-repositories"/>
</sample>
++++

[NOTE]
====
The order of declaration determines how Gradle will check for dependencies at runtime. If Gradle finds a module descriptor in a particular repository, it will attempt to download all of the artifacts for that module from _the same repository_. You can learn more about <<sec:dependency_resolution,Gradle's resolution mechanism>> below.
====

[[sec:dependency_resolution]]
=== How dependency resolution works

Gradle takes your dependency declarations and repository definitions and attempts to download all of your dependencies by a process called _dependency resolution_. Below is a brief outline of how this process works.

* Given a required dependency, Gradle first attempts to resolve the _module_ for that dependency. Each repository is inspected in order, searching first for a _module descriptor_ file (POM or Ivy file) that indicates the presence of that module. If no module descriptor is found, Gradle will search for the presence of the primary _module artifact_ file indicating that the module exists in the repository.

** If the dependency is declared as a dynamic version (like `1.+`), Gradle will resolve this to the newest available static version (like `1.2`) in the repository. For Maven repositories, this is done using the `maven-metadata.xml` file, while for Ivy repositories this is done by directory listing.

** If the module descriptor is a POM file that has a parent POM declared, Gradle will recursively attempt to resolve each of the parent modules for the POM.

* Once each repository has been inspected for the module, Gradle will choose the 'best' one to use. This is done using the following criteria:

** For a dynamic version, a 'higher' static version is preferred over a 'lower' version.

** Modules declared by a module descriptor file (Ivy or POM file) are preferred over modules that have an artifact file only.

** Modules from earlier repositories are preferred over modules in later repositories.

** When the dependency is declared by a static version and a module descriptor file is found in a repository, there is no need to continue searching later repositories and the remainder of the process is short-circuited.

* All of the artifacts for the module are then requested from the _same repository_ that was chosen in the process above.


[[sec:finetuning_the_dependency_resolution_process]]
=== Fine-tuning the dependency resolution process

In most cases, Gradle's default dependency management will resolve the dependencies that you want in your build. In some cases, however, it can be necessary to tweak dependency resolution to ensure that your build receives exactly the right dependencies.

There are a number of ways that you can influence how Gradle resolves dependencies.


[[sec:forcing_modules]]
==== Forcing a particular module version

Forcing a module version tells Gradle to always use a specific version for given dependency (transitive or not), overriding any version specified in a published module descriptor. This can be very useful when tackling version conflicts - for more information see <<sub:version_conflicts>>.

Force versions can also be used to deal with rogue metadata of transitive dependencies. If a transitive dependency has poor quality metadata that leads to problems at dependency resolution time, you can force Gradle to use a newer, fixed version of this dependency. For an example, see the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[] class in the API documentation. Note that 'dependency resolve rules' (outlined below) provide a more powerful mechanism for replacing a broken module dependency. See <<sec:blacklisting_version>>.

[[sec:prefer_project_modules]]
==== Preferring modules that are part of the build

Preferring project modules tells Gradle to use the version of a module that is part of the build itself (as part of <<multi_project_builds>> or as includes in <<composite_builds>>). This allows the easy inclusion of an individual fork (e.g. containing a bugfix) of a module - for more information see <<sub:version_conflicts>>.

[[sec:dependency_resolve_rules]]
==== Using dependency resolve rules

A dependency resolve rule is executed for each resolved dependency, and offers a powerful api for manipulating a requested dependency prior to that dependency being resolved. This feature is <<feature_lifecycle,incubating>>, but currently offers the ability to change the group, name and/or version of a requested dependency, allowing a dependency to be substituted with a completely different module during resolution.

Dependency resolve rules provide a very powerful way to control the dependency resolution process, and can be used to implement all sorts of advanced patterns in dependency management. Some of these patterns are outlined below. For more information and code samples see the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[] class in the API documentation.


[[sec:releasable_unit]]
===== Modelling releasable units

Often an organisation publishes a set of libraries with a single version; where the libraries are built, tested and published together. These libraries form a 'releasable unit', designed and intended to be used as a whole. It does not make sense to use libraries from different releasable units together.

But it is easy for transitive dependency resolution to violate this contract. For example:

* `module-a` depends on `releasable-unit:part-one:1.0`
* `module-b` depends on `releasable-unit:part-two:1.1`

A build depending on both `module-a` and `module-b` will obtain different versions of libraries within the releasable unit.

Dependency resolve rules give you the power to enforce releasable units in your build. Imagine a releasable unit defined by all libraries that have 'org.gradle' group. We can force all of these libraries to use a consistent version:
++++
<sample id="releasable-unit" dir="userguide/artifacts/resolutionStrategy" title="Forcing consistent version for a group of libraries">
                        <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="releasable-unit"/>
                    </sample>
++++

[[sec:custom_versioning_scheme]]
===== Implement a custom versioning scheme

In some corporate environments, the list of module versions that can be declared in Gradle builds is maintained and audited externally. Dependency resolve rules provide a neat implementation of this pattern:

* In the build script, the developer declares dependencies with the module group and name, but uses a placeholder version, for example: `'default'`.
* The 'default' version is resolved to a specific version via a dependency resolve rule, which looks up the version in a corporate catalog of approved modules.

This rule implementation can be neatly encapsulated in a corporate plugin, and shared across all builds within the organisation.
++++
<sample id="custom-versioning-scheme" dir="userguide/artifacts/resolutionStrategy" title="Using a custom versioning scheme">
                        <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="custom-versioning-scheme"/>
                    </sample>
++++

[[sec:blacklisting_version]]
===== Blacklisting a particular version with a replacement

Dependency resolve rules provide a mechanism for blacklisting a particular version of a dependency and providing a replacement version. This can be useful if a certain dependency version is broken and should not be used, where a dependency resolve rule causes this version to be replaced with a known good version. One example of a broken module is one that declares a dependency on a library that cannot be found in any of the public repositories, but there are many other reasons why a particular module version is unwanted and a different version is preferred.

In example below, imagine that version `1.2.1` contains important fixes and should always be used in preference to `1.2`. The rule provided will enforce just this: any time version `1.2` is encountered it will be replaced with `1.2.1`. Note that this is different from a forced version as described above, in that any other versions of this module would not be affected. This means that the 'newest' conflict resolution strategy would still select version `1.3` if this version was also pulled transitively.
++++
<sample id="blacklisting_version" dir="userguide/artifacts/resolutionStrategy" title="Blacklisting a version with a replacement">
                        <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="blacklisting_version"/>
                    </sample>
++++


[[sec:module_substitution]]
===== Substituting a dependency module with a compatible replacement

At times a completely different module can serve as a replacement for a requested module dependency. Examples include using `'groovy'` in place of `'groovy-all'`, or using `'log4j-over-slf4j'` instead of `'log4j'`. Starting with Gradle 1.5 you can make these substitutions using dependency resolve rules:
++++
<sample id="module_substitution" dir="userguide/artifacts/resolutionStrategy" title="Changing dependency group and/or name at the resolution">
                        <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="module_substitution"/>
                    </sample>
++++


[[dependency_substitution_rules]]
==== Dependency Substitution Rules

Dependency substitution rules work similarly to dependency resolve rules. In fact, many capabilities of dependency resolve rules can be implemented with dependency substitution rules. They allow project and module dependencies to be transparently substituted with specified replacements. Unlike dependency resolve rules, dependency substitution rules allow project and module dependencies to be substituted interchangeably.

_Adding a dependency substitution rule to a configuration changes the timing of when that configuration is resolved._ Instead of being resolved on first use, the configuration is instead resolved when the task graph is being constructed. This can have unexpected consequences if the configuration is being further modified during task execution, or if the configuration relies on modules that are published during execution of another task.

To explain:

* A `Configuration` can be declared as an input to any Task, and that configuration can include project dependencies when it is resolved.
* If a project dependency is an input to a Task (via a configuration), then tasks to build the project artifacts must be added to the task dependencies.
* In order to determine the project dependencies that are inputs to a task, Gradle needs to resolve the `Configuration` inputs.
* Because the Gradle task graph is fixed once task execution has commenced, Gradle needs to perform this resolution prior to executing any tasks.

In the absence of dependency substitution rules, Gradle knows that an external module dependency will never transitively reference a project dependency. This makes it easy to determine the full set of project dependencies for a configuration through simple graph traversal. With this functionality, Gradle can no longer make this assumption, and must perform a full resolve in order to determine the project dependencies.


[[sec:module_to_project_substitution]]
===== Substituting an external module dependency with a project dependency

One use case for dependency substitution is to use a locally developed version of a module in place of one that is downloaded from an external repository. This could be useful for testing a local, patched version of a dependency.

The module to be replaced can be declared with or without a version specified.

++++
<sample id="module_to_project_substitution" dir="userguide/artifacts/dependency-substitution" title="Substituting a module with a project">
                    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="module_to_project_substitution"/>
                </sample>
++++

Note that a project that is substituted must be included in the multi-project build (via settings.gradle). Dependency substitution rules take care of replacing the module dependency with the project dependency and wiring up any task dependencies, but do not implicitly include the project in the build.

[[sec:project_to_module_substitution]]
===== Substituting a project dependency with a module replacement

Another way to use substitution rules is to replace a project dependency with a module in a multi-project build. This can be useful to speed up development with a large multi-project build, by allowing a subset of the project dependencies to be downloaded from a repository rather than being built.

The module to be used as a replacement must be declared with a version specified.

++++
<sample id="project_to_module_substitution" dir="userguide/artifacts/dependency-substitution" title="Substituting a project with a module">
                    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="project_to_module_substitution"/>
                </sample>
++++

When a project dependency has been replaced with a module dependency, that project is still included in the overall multi-project build. However, tasks to build the replaced dependency will not be executed in order to build the resolve the depending `Configuration`.

[[sec:conditional_dependency_substitution]]
===== Conditionally substituting a dependency

A common use case for dependency substitution is to allow more flexible assembly of sub-projects within a multi-project build. This can be useful for developing a local, patched version of an external dependency or for building a subset of the modules within a large multi-project build.

The following example uses a dependency substitution rule to replace any module dependency with the group "org.example", but only if a local project matching the dependency name can be located.

++++
<sample id="project_substitution" dir="dependency-substitution" title="Conditionally substituting a dependency">
                    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="project_substitution"/>
                </sample>
++++

Note that a project that is substituted must be included in the multi-project build (via settings.gradle). Dependency substitution rules take care of replacing the module dependency with the project dependency, but do not implicitly include the project in the build.

[[sec:configuration_defaults]]
==== Specifying default dependencies for a configuration

A configuration can be configured with default dependencies to be used if no dependencies are explicitly set for the configuration. A primary use case of this functionality is for developing plugins that make use of versioned tools that the user might override. By specifying default dependencies, the plugin can use a default version of the tool only if the user has not specified a particular version to use.

++++
<sample id="configuration_default_dependencies" dir="userguide/artifacts/defineConfiguration" title="Specifying default dependencies on a configuration">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="configuration-default-dependencies"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[ivy_dynamic_resolve_mode]]
==== Enabling Ivy dynamic resolve mode

Gradle's Ivy repository implementations support the equivalent to Ivy's dynamic resolve mode. Normally, Gradle will use the `rev` attribute for each dependency definition included in an `ivy.xml` file. In dynamic resolve mode, Gradle will instead prefer the `revConstraint` attribute over the `rev` attribute for a given dependency definition. If the `revConstraint` attribute is not present, the `rev` attribute is used instead.

To enable dynamic resolve mode, you need to set the appropriate option on the repository definition. A couple of examples are shown below. Note that dynamic resolve mode is only available for Gradle's Ivy repositories. It is not available for Maven repositories, or custom Ivy `DependencyResolver` implementations.

++++
<sample id="dynamicResolveMode" dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository" title="Enabling dynamic resolve mode">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="ivy-repo-dynamic-mode"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[component_metadata_rules]]
==== Component metadata rules

Each module (also called _component_) has metadata associated with it, such as its group, name, version, dependencies, and so on. This metadata typically originates in the module's descriptor. Metadata rules allow certain parts of a module's metadata to be manipulated from within the build script. They take effect after a module's descriptor has been downloaded, but before it has been selected among all candidate versions. This makes metadata rules another instrument for customizing dependency resolution.

One piece of module metadata that Gradle understands is a module's _status scheme_. This concept, also known from Ivy, models the different levels of maturity that a module transitions through over time. The default status scheme, ordered from least to most mature status, is `integration`, `milestone`, `release`. Apart from a status scheme, a module also has a (current) _status_, which must be one of the values in its status scheme. If not specified in the (Ivy) descriptor, the status defaults to `integration` for Ivy modules and Maven snapshot modules, and `release` for Maven modules that aren't snapshots.

A module's status and status scheme are taken into consideration when a `latest` version selector is resolved. Specifically, `latest.someStatus` will resolve to the highest module version that has status `someStatus` or a more mature status. For example, with the default status scheme in place, `latest.integration` will select the highest module version regardless of its status (because `integration` is the least mature status), whereas `latest.release` will select the highest module version with status `release`. Here is what this looks like in code:

++++
<sample id="latestSelector" dir="componentMetadataRules" title="'Latest' version selector">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="latest-selector"/>
                <output args="-q listConfigs"/>
            </sample>
++++

The next example demonstrates `latest` selectors based on a custom status scheme declared in a component metadata rule that applies to all modules:

++++
<sample id="customStatusScheme" dir="componentMetadataRules" title="Custom status scheme">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="custom-status-scheme"/>
            </sample>
++++

Component metadata rules can be applied to a specified module. Modules must be specified in the form of "group:module".

++++
<sample id="customStatusSchemeModule" dir="componentMetadataRules" title="Custom status scheme by module">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="custom-status-scheme-module"/>
            </sample>
++++

Gradle can also create component metadata rules utilizing Ivy-specific metadata for modules resolved from an Ivy repository. Values from the Ivy descriptor are made available via the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ivy.IvyModuleDescriptor[] interface.

++++
<sample id="ivyComponentMetadataRule" dir="componentMetadataRules" title="Ivy component metadata rule">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="ivy-component-metadata-rule"/>
            </sample>
++++

Note that any rule that declares specific arguments must _always_ include a api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentMetadataDetails[] argument as the first argument. The second Ivy metadata argument is optional.

Component metadata rules can also be defined using a _rule source_ object. A rule source object is any object that contains exactly one method that defines the rule action and is annotated with `@Mutate`.

This method:

* must return void.
* must have api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentMetadataDetails[] as the first argument.
* may have an additional parameter of type api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ivy.IvyModuleDescriptor[].

++++
<sample id="ruleSourceComponentMetadataRule" dir="componentMetadataRules" title="Rule source component metadata rule">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="rule-source-component-metadata-rule"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[component_selection_rules]]
==== Component Selection Rules

Component selection rules may influence which component instance should be selected when multiple versions are available that match a version selector. Rules are applied against every available version and allow the version to be explicitly rejected by rule. This allows Gradle to ignore any component instance that does not satisfy conditions set by the rule. Examples include:

* For a dynamic version like '1.+' certain versions may be explicitly rejected from selection
* For a static version like '1.4' an instance may be rejected based on extra component metadata such as the Ivy branch attribute, allowing an instance from a subsequent repository to be used.

Rules are configured via the api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelectionRules[] object. Each rule configured will be called with a api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelection[] object as an argument which contains information about the candidate version being considered. Calling api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelection#reject[] causes the given candidate version to be explicitly rejected, in which case the candidate will not be considered for the selector.

The following example shows a rule that disallows a particular version of a module but allows the dynamic version to choose the next best candidate.

++++
<sample id="componentSelectionRulesReject" dir="componentSelectionRules" title="Component selection rule">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="reject-version-1.1"/>
            </sample>
++++

Note that version selection is applied starting with the highest version first. The version selected will be the first version found that all component selection rules accept. A version is considered accepted no rule explicitly rejects it.

Similarly, rules can be targeted at specific modules. Modules must be specified in the form of "group:module".

++++
<sample id="componentSelectionRulesTarget" dir="componentSelectionRules" title="Component selection rule with module target">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="targeted-component-selection"/>
            </sample>
++++

Component selection rules can also consider component metadata when selecting a version. Possible metadata arguments that can be considered are api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentMetadata[] and api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ivy.IvyModuleDescriptor[].

++++
<sample id="componentSelectionRulesMetadata" dir="componentSelectionRules" title="Component selection rule with metadata">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="component-selection-with-metadata"/>
            </sample>
++++

Note that a api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelection[] argument is _always_ required as the first parameter when declaring a component selection rule with additional Ivy metadata parameters, but the metadata parameters can be declared in any order.

Lastly, component selection rules can also be defined using a _rule source_ object. A rule source object is any object that contains exactly one method that defines the rule action and is annotated with `@Mutate`.

This method:

* must return void.
* must have api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentSelection[] as the first argument.
* may have additional parameters of type api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ComponentMetadata[] and/or api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ivy.IvyModuleDescriptor[].

++++
<sample id="componentSelectionRulesRuleSource" dir="componentSelectionRules" title="Component selection rule using a rule source object">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="api-component-selection"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[sec:module_replacement]]
==== Module replacement rules

Module replacement rules allow a build to declare that a legacy library has been replaced by a new one. A good example when a new library replaced a legacy one is the "google-collections" -&gt; "guava" migration. The team that created google-collections decided to change the module name from "com.google.collections:google-collections" into "com.google.guava:guava". This is a legal scenario in the industry: teams need to be able to change the names of products they maintain, including the module coordinates. Renaming of the module coordinates has impact on conflict resolution.

To explain the impact on conflict resolution, let's consider the "google-collections" -&gt; "guava" scenario. It may happen that both libraries are pulled into the same dependency graph. For example, "our" project depends on guava but some of our dependencies pull in a legacy version of google-collections. This can cause runtime errors, for example during test or application execution. Gradle does not automatically resolve the google-collections VS guava conflict because it is not considered as a "version conflict". It's because the module coordinates for both libraries are completely different and conflict resolution is activated when "group" and "name" coordinates are the same but there are different versions available in the dependency graph (for more info, refer to the section on conflict resolution). Traditional remedies to this problem are:

* Declare exclusion rule to avoid pulling in "google-collections" to graph. It is probably the most popular approach.
* Avoid dependencies that pull in legacy libraries.
* Upgrade the dependency version if the new version no longer pulls in a legacy library.
* Downgrade to "google-collections". It's not recommended, just mentioned for completeness.

Traditional approaches work but they are not general enough. For example, an organisation wants to resolve the google-collections VS guava conflict resolution problem in all projects. Starting from Gradle 2.2 it is possible to declare that certain module was replaced by other. This enables organisations to include the information about module replacement in the corporate plugin suite and resolve the problem holistically for all Gradle-powered projects in the enterprise.
++++
<sample id="module_replacement_declaration" dir="userguide/artifacts/componentModuleMetadata" title="Declaring module replacement">
                    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="module_replacement_declaration"/>
                </sample>
++++

For more examples and detailed API, refer to the DSL reference for api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ComponentMetadataHandler[].

What happens when we declare that "google-collections" are replaced by "guava"? Gradle can use this information for conflict resolution. Gradle will consider every version of "guava" newer/better than any version of "google-collections". Also, Gradle will ensure that only guava jar is present in the classpath / resolved file list. Note that if only "google-collections" appears in the dependency graph (e.g. no "guava") Gradle will not eagerly replace it with "guava". Module replacement is an information that Gradle uses for resolving conflicts. If there is no conflict (e.g. only "google-collections" or only "guava" in the graph) the replacement information is not used.

Currently it is not possible to declare that certain modules is replaced by a set of modules. However, it is possible to declare that multiple modules are replaced by a single module.

[[sec:dependency_cache]]
=== The dependency cache

Gradle contains a highly sophisticated dependency caching mechanism, which seeks to minimise the number of remote requests made in dependency resolution, while striving to guarantee that the results of dependency resolution are correct and reproducible.

The Gradle dependency cache consists of 2 key types of storage:

* A file-based store of downloaded artifacts, including binaries like jars as well as raw downloaded meta-data like POM files and Ivy files. The storage path for a downloaded artifact includes the SHA1 checksum, meaning that 2 artifacts with the same name but different content can easily be cached.
* A binary store of resolved module meta-data, including the results of resolving dynamic versions, module descriptors, and artifacts.

Separating the storage of downloaded artifacts from the cache metadata permits us to do some very powerful things with our cache that would be difficult with a transparent, file-only cache layout.

The Gradle cache does not allow the local cache to hide problems and create other mysterious and difficult to debug behavior that has been a challenge with many build tools. This new behavior is implemented in a bandwidth and storage efficient way. In doing so, Gradle enables reliable and reproducible enterprise builds.


[[sec:cache_features]]
==== Key features of the Gradle dependency cache


[[sub:cache_metadata]]
===== Separate metadata cache

Gradle keeps a record of various aspects of dependency resolution in binary format in the metadata cache. The information stored in the metadata cache includes:

* The result of resolving a dynamic version (e.g. `1.+`) to a concrete version (e.g. `1.2`).
* The resolved module metadata for a particular module, including module artifacts and module dependencies.
* The resolved artifact metadata for a particular artifact, including a pointer to the downloaded artifact file.
* The _absence_ of a particular module or artifact in a particular repository, eliminating repeated attempts to access a resource that does not exist.

Every entry in the metadata cache includes a record of the repository that provided the information as well as a timestamp that can be used for cache expiry.

[[sub:cache_repository_independence]]
===== Repository caches are independent

As described above, for each repository there is a separate metadata cache. A repository is identified by its URL, type and layout. If a module or artifact has not been previously resolved from _this repository_, Gradle will attempt to resolve the module against the repository. This will always involve a remote lookup on the repository, however in many cases no download will be required (see <<sub:cache_artifact_reuse>>, below).

Dependency resolution will fail if the required artifacts are not available in any repository specified by the build, even if the local cache has a copy of this artifact which was retrieved from a different repository. Repository independence allows builds to be isolated from each other in an advanced way that no build tool has done before. This is a key feature to create builds that are reliable and reproducible in any environment.

[[sub:cache_artifact_reuse]]
===== Artifact reuse

Before downloading an artifact, Gradle tries to determine the checksum of the required artifact by downloading the sha file associated with that artifact. If the checksum can be retrieved, an artifact is not downloaded if an artifact already exists with the same id and checksum. If the checksum cannot be retrieved from the remote server, the artifact will be downloaded (and ignored if it matches an existing artifact).

As well as considering artifacts downloaded from a different repository, Gradle will also attempt to reuse artifacts found in the local Maven Repository. If a candidate artifact has been downloaded by Maven, Gradle will use this artifact if it can be verified to match the checksum declared by the remote server.

[[sub:cache_checksum_storage]]
===== Checksum based storage

It is possible for different repositories to provide a different binary artifact in response to the same artifact identifier. This is often the case with Maven SNAPSHOT artifacts, but can also be true for any artifact which is republished without changing its identifier. By caching artifacts based on their SHA1 checksum, Gradle is able to maintain multiple versions of the same artifact. This means that when resolving against one repository Gradle will never overwrite the cached artifact file from a different repository. This is done without requiring a separate artifact file store per repository.

[[sub:cache_locking]]
===== Cache Locking

The Gradle dependency cache uses file-based locking to ensure that it can safely be used by multiple Gradle processes concurrently. The lock is held whenever the binary meta-data store is being read or written, but is released for slow operations such as downloading remote artifacts.

[[sec:cache_command_line_options]]
==== Command line options to override caching


[[sub:cache_offline]]
===== Offline

The `--offline` command line switch tells Gradle to always use dependency modules from the cache, regardless if they are due to be checked again. When running with offline, Gradle will never attempt to access the network to perform dependency resolution. If required modules are not present in the dependency cache, build execution will fail.

[[sub:cache_refresh]]
===== Refresh

At times, the Gradle Dependency Cache can be out of sync with the actual state of the configured repositories. Perhaps a repository was initially misconfigured, or perhaps a “non-changing” module was published incorrectly. To refresh all dependencies in the dependency cache, use the `--refresh-dependencies` option on the command line.

The `--refresh-dependencies` option tells Gradle to ignore all cached entries for resolved modules and artifacts. A fresh resolve will be performed against all configured repositories, with dynamic versions recalculated, modules refreshed, and artifacts downloaded. However, where possible Gradle will check if the previously downloaded artifacts are valid before downloading again. This is done by comparing published SHA1 values in the repository with the SHA1 values for existing downloaded artifacts.

[[sec:controlling_caching]]
==== Fine-tuned control over dependency caching

You can fine-tune certain aspects of caching using the `ResolutionStrategy` for a configuration.

By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions for 24 hours. To change how long Gradle will cache the resolved version for a dynamic version, use:

++++
<sample id="dynamic-version-cache-control" dir="userguide/artifacts/resolutionStrategy" title="Dynamic version cache control">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dynamic-version-cache-control"/>
            </sample>
++++

By default, Gradle caches changing modules for 24 hours. To change how long Gradle will cache the meta-data and artifacts for a changing module, use:

++++
<sample id="changing-module-cache-control" dir="userguide/artifacts/resolutionStrategy" title="Changing module cache control">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="changing-module-cache-control"/>
            </sample>
++++

For more details, take a look at the API documentation for api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[].

[[sec:dependency_management_overview]]
=== Dependency management best practices

While Gradle has strong opinions on dependency management, the tool gives you a choice between two options: follow recommended best practices or support any kind of pattern you can think of. This section outlines the Gradle project's recommended best practices for managing dependencies.

No matter what the language, proper dependency management is important for every project. From a complex enterprise application written in Java depending on hundreds of open source libraries to the simplest Clojure application depending on a handful of libraries, approaches to dependency management vary widely and can depend on the target technology, the method of application deployment, and the nature of the project. Projects bundled as reusable libraries may have different requirements than enterprise applications integrated into much larger systems of software and infrastructure. Despite this wide variation of requirements, the Gradle project recommends that all projects follow this set of core rules:


[[sub:versioning_the_jar_name]]
==== Put the Version in the Filename (Version the jar)

The version of a library must be part of the filename. While the version of a jar is usually in the Manifest file, it isn't readily apparent when you are inspecting a project. If someone asks you to look at a collection of 20 jar files, which would you prefer? A collection of files with names like `commons-beanutils-1.3.jar` or a collection of files with names like `spring.jar`? If dependencies have file names with version numbers you can quickly identify the versions of your dependencies.

If versions are unclear you can introduce subtle bugs which are very hard to find. For example there might be a project which uses Hibernate 2.5. Think about a developer who decides to install version 3.0.5 of Hibernate on her machine to fix a critical security bug but forgets to notify others in the team of this change. She may address the security bug successfully, but she also may have introduced subtle bugs into a codebase that was using a now-deprecated feature from Hibernate. Weeks later there is an exception on the integration machine which can't be reproduced on anyone's machine. Multiple developers then spend days on this issue only finally realising that the error would have been easy to uncover if they knew that Hibernate had been upgraded from 2.5 to 3.0.5.

Versions in jar names increase the expressiveness of your project and make them easier to maintain. This practice also reduces the potential for error.

[[sub:transitive_dependency_management]]
==== Manage transitive dependencies

Transitive dependency management is a technique that enables your project to depend on libraries which, in turn, depend on other libraries. This recursive pattern of transitive dependencies results in a tree of dependencies including your project's first-level dependencies, second-level dependencies, and so on. If you don't model your dependencies as a hierarchical tree of first-level and second-level dependencies it is very easy to quickly lose control over an assembled mess of unstructured dependencies. Consider the Gradle project itself, while Gradle only has a few direct, first-level dependencies, when Gradle is compiled it needs more than one hundred dependencies on the classpath. On a far larger scale, Enterprise projects using Spring, Hibernate, and other libraries, alongside hundreds or thousands of internal projects, can result in very large dependency trees.

When these large dependency trees need to change, you'll often have to solve some dependency version conflicts. Say one open source library needs one version of a logging library and a another uses an alternative version. Gradle and other build tools all have the ability to resolve conflicts, but what differentiates Gradle is the control it gives you over transitive dependencies and conflict resolution.

While you could try to manage this problem manually, you will quickly find that this approach doesn't scale. If you want to get rid of a first level dependency you really can't be sure which other jars you should remove. A dependency of a first level dependency might also be a first level dependency itself, or it might be a transitive dependency of yet another first level dependency. If you try to manage transitive dependencies yourself, the end of the story is that your build becomes brittle: no one dares to change your dependencies because the risk of breaking the build is too high. The project classpath becomes a complete mess, and, if a classpath problem arises, hell on earth invites you for a ride.

[NOTE]
====
_NOTE:_ In one project, we found a mystery LDAP related jar in the classpath. No code referenced this jar and there was no connection to the project. No one could figure out what the jar was for, until it was removed from the build and the application suffered massive performance problems whenever it attempted to authenticate to LDAP. This mystery jar was a necessary transitive, fourth-level dependency that was easy to miss because no one had bothered to use managed transitive dependencies.
====

Gradle offers you different ways to express first-level and transitive dependencies. With Gradle you can mix and match approaches; for example, you could store your jars in an SCM without XML descriptor files and still use transitive dependency management.

[[sub:version_conflicts]]
==== Resolve version conflicts

Conflicting versions of the same jar should be detected and either resolved or cause an exception. If you don't use transitive dependency management, version conflicts are undetected and the often accidental order of the classpath will determine what version of a dependency will win. On a large project with many developers changing dependencies, successful builds will be few and far between as the order of dependencies may directly affect whether a build succeeds or fails (or whether a bug appears or disappears in production).

If you haven't had to deal with the curse of conflicting versions of jars on a classpath, here is a small anecdote of the fun that awaits you. In a large project with 30 submodules, adding a dependency to a subproject changed the order of a classpath, swapping Spring 2.5 for an older 2.4 version. While the build continued to work, developers were starting to notice all sorts of surprising (and surprisingly awful) bugs in production. Worse yet, this unintentional downgrade of Spring introduced several security vulnerabilities into the system, which now required a full security audit throughout the organization.

In short, version conflicts are bad, and you should manage your transitive dependencies to avoid them. You might also want to learn where conflicting versions are used and consolidate on a particular version of a dependency across your organization. With a good conflict reporting tool like Gradle, that information can be used to communicate with the entire organization and standardize on a single version. _If you think version conflicts don't happen to you, think again._ It is very common for different first-level dependencies to rely on a range of different overlapping versions for other dependencies, and the JVM doesn't yet offer an easy way to have different versions of the same jar in the classpath (see <<sub:dependency_management_and_java>>).

Gradle offers the following conflict resolution strategies:

* _Newest_: The newest version of the dependency is used. This is Gradle's default strategy, and is often an appropriate choice as long as versions are backwards-compatible.
* _Fail_: A version conflict results in a build failure. This strategy requires all version conflicts to be resolved explicitly in the build script. See api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[] for details on how to explicitly choose a particular version.

While the strategies introduced above are usually enough to solve most conflicts, Gradle provides more fine-grained mechanisms to resolve version conflicts:

* Configuring a first level dependency as _forced_. This approach is useful if the dependency in conflict is already a first level dependency. See examples in api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler[].
* Configuring any dependency (transitive or not) as _forced_. This approach is useful if the dependency in conflict is a transitive dependency. It also can be used to force versions of first level dependencies. See examples in api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[].
* Configuring dependency resolution to _prefer modules that are part of your build_ (transitive or not). This approach is useful if your build contains custom forks of modules (as part of <<multi_project_builds>> or as include in <<composite_builds>>). See examples in api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy[].
* Dependency resolve rules are an <<feature_lifecycle,incubating>> feature give you fine-grained control over the version selected for a particular dependency.

To deal with problems due to version conflicts, reports with dependency graphs are also very helpful. Such reports are another feature of dependency management.

[[sub:dynamic_versions_and_changing_modules]]
==== Use Dynamic Versions and Changing Modules

There are many situations when you want to use the latest version of a particular dependency, or the latest in a range of versions. This can be a requirement during development, or you may be developing a library that is designed to work with a range of dependency versions. You can easily depend on these constantly changing dependencies by using a _dynamic version_. A dynamic version can be either a version range (e.g. `2.+`) or it can be a placeholder for the latest version available (e.g. `latest.integration`).

Alternatively, sometimes the module you request can change over time, even for the same version. An example of this type of _changing module_ is a Maven `SNAPSHOT` module, which always points at the latest artifact published. In other words, a standard Maven snapshot is a module that never stands still so to speak, it is a “changing module”.

The main difference between a _dynamic version_ and a _changing module_ is that when you resolve a _dynamic version_, you'll get the real, static version as the module name. When you resolve a _changing module_, the artifacts are named using the version you requested, but the underlying artifacts may change over time.

By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions and changing modules for 24 hours. You can override the default cache modes using <<sec:cache_command_line_options,command line options>>. You can change the cache expiry times in your build using the resolution strategy (see <<sec:controlling_caching>>).

[[sec:strategies_of_transitive_dependency_management]]
=== Strategies for transitive dependency management

Many projects rely on the https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2[Maven Central repository]. This is not without problems.

* The Maven Central repository can be down or can be slow to respond.
* The POM files of many popular projects specify dependencies or other configuration that are just plain wrong (for instance, the POM file of the “`commons-httpclient-3.0`” module declares JUnit as a runtime dependency).
* For many projects there is not one right set of dependencies (as more or less imposed by the POM format).

If your project relies on the Maven Central repository you are likely to need an additional custom repository, because:

* You might need dependencies that are not uploaded to Maven Central yet.
* You want to deal properly with invalid metadata in a Maven Central POM file.
* You don't want to expose people to the downtimes or slow response of Maven Central, if they just want to build your project.

It is not a big deal to set-up a custom repository,footnote:[If you want to shield your project from the downtimes of Maven Central things get more complicated. You probably want to set-up a repository proxy for this. In an enterprise environment this is rather common. For an open source project it looks like overkill.] but it can be tedious to keep it up to date. For a new version, you always have to create the new XML descriptor and the directories. Your custom repository is another infrastructure element which might have downtimes and needs to be updated. To enable historical builds, you need to keep all the past libraries, not to mention a backup of these. It is another layer of indirection. Another source of information you have to lookup. All this is not really a big deal but in its sum it has an impact. Repository managers like Artifactory or Nexus make this easier, but most open source projects don't usually have a host for those products. This is changing with new services like http://bintray.com[Bintray] that let developers host and distribute their release binaries using a self-service repository platform. Bintray also supports sharing approved artifacts though the http://jcenter.bintray.com[JCenter] public repository to provide a single resolution address for all popular OSS Java artifacts (see <<sub:maven_jcenter>>).

This is a common reason why many projects prefer to store their libraries in their version control system. This approach is fully supported by Gradle. The libraries can be stored in a flat directory without any XML module descriptor files. Yet Gradle offers complete transitive dependency management. You can use either client module dependencies to express the dependency relations, or artifact dependencies in case a first level dependency has no transitive dependencies. People can check out such a project from your source code control system and have everything necessary to build it.

If you are working with a distributed version control system like Git you probably don't want to use the version control system to store libraries as people check out the whole history. But even here the flexibility of Gradle can make your life easier. For example, you can use a shared flat directory without XML descriptors and yet you can have full transitive dependency management, as described above.

You could also have a mixed strategy. If your main concern is bad metadata in the POM file and maintaining custom XML descriptors, then _Client Modules_ offer an alternative. However, you can still use a Maven2 repo or your custom repository as a repository for _jars only_ and still enjoy _transitive_ dependency management. Or you can only provide client modules for POMs with bad metadata. For the jars and the correct POMs you still use the remote repository.


[[sub:implicit_transitive_dependencies]]
==== Implicit transitive dependencies

There is another way to deal with transitive dependencies _without_ XML descriptor files. You can do this with Gradle, but we don't recommend it. We mention it for the sake of completeness and comparison with other build tools.

The trick is to use only artifact dependencies and group them in lists. This will directly express your first level dependencies and your transitive dependencies (see <<sec:optional_attributes>>). The problem with this is that Gradle dependency management will see this as specifying all dependencies as first level dependencies. The dependency reports won't show your real dependency graph and the `compile` task uses all dependencies, not just the first level dependencies. All in all, your build is less maintainable and reliable than it could be when using client modules, and you don't gain anything.
