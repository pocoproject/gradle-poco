[[osgi_plugin]]
= The OSGi Plugin

The OSGi plugin provides a factory method to create an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/osgi/OsgiManifest.html[OsgiManifest] object. `OsgiManifest` extends link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/java/archives/Manifest.html[Manifest]. To learn more about generic manifest handling, see <<java_plugin.adoc#sub:manifest,more about Java manifests>>. If the Java plugins is applied, the OSGi plugin replaces the manifest object of the default jar with an `OsgiManifest` object. The replaced manifest is merged into the new one.

[NOTE]
====
The OSGi plugin makes heavy use of the http://bnd.bndtools.org/[BND tool]. A separate https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/biz.aQute.bnd.gradle/README.md[plugin implementation] is maintained by the BND authors that has more advanced features.

[[sec:osgi_usage]]
== Usage

To use the OSGi plugin, include the following in your build script:

=== Example: Using the OSGi plugin

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{samplesPath}/osgi/build.gradle[tag=use-plugin]
----


[[sec:osgi_implicitly_applied_plugins]]
== Implicitly applied plugins

Applies the Java base plugin.

[[sec:osgi_tasks]]
== Tasks

The OSGi plugin adds the following tasks to the project:

`osgiClasses` â€” link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.Sync.html[Sync]::
_Depends on_: `classes`
+
Copies all classes from the main source set to a single directory that is processed by BND.


[[sec:osgi_convention_object]]
== Convention object

The OSGi plugin adds the following convention object: link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/osgi/OsgiPluginConvention.html[OsgiPluginConvention]


[[sec:osgi_convention_properties]]
=== Convention properties

The OSGi plugin does not add any convention properties to the project.

[[sec:osgi_convention_methods]]
=== Convention methods

The OSGi plugin adds the following methods. For more details, see the API documentation of the convention object.

.OSGi methods
[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Method | Return Type | Description

| osgiManifest()
| link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/osgi/OsgiManifest.html[OsgiManifest]
| Returns an OsgiManifest object.

| osgiManifest(Closure cl)
| link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/osgi/OsgiManifest.html[OsgiManifest]
| Returns an OsgiManifest object configured by the closure.
|===

The classes in the classes dir are analyzed regarding their package dependencies and the packages they expose. Based on this the _Import-Package_ and the _Export-Package_ values of the OSGi Manifest are calculated. If the classpath contains jars with an OSGi bundle, the bundle information is used to specify version information for the _Import-Package_ value. Beside the explicit properties of the `OsgiManifest` object you can add instructions.

=== Example: Configuration of OSGi MANIFEST.MF file

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/tutorial/osgi/build.gradle[tag=configure-jar]
----

The first argument of the instruction call is the key of the property. The other arguments form the value. To learn more about the available instructions have a look at the http://bnd.bndtools.org/[BND tool].
